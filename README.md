## Research Experience
### Harmonizing Functional Connectivity Data Collected from Multiple Scanners/Sites
- Developed a sparse tensor decomposition method for localizing and mitigating inter-scanner/-site variability in functional connectivity, while preserving functional activity patterns after harmonization.
- Proposed an enhanced EM algorithm for estimation.

### SAN: Mitigating Spatial Covariance Heterogeneity in Cortical Thickness Data Collected from Multiple Scanners or Sites
[Publication](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/hbm.26692)
- Developed the Spatial Autocorrelation Normalization (SAN) technique to ensure spatially homogeneous neuroimaging data across different sites and MRI scanners by reducing unwanted technical variations at the vertex level.
- Demonstrated through real data and simulations that SAN outperforms existing methods in reducing covariance variations, improving data quality and reproducibility.
- Developed an efficient [R package (SAN)](https://github.com/junjypark/SAN) to share simulated examples and codes.

### A Structured Multivariate Approach for Removing Latent Inter-Scanner Effects
[Publication](https://direct.mit.edu/imag/article/doi/10.1162/imag_a_00011/116599/RELIEF-A-structured-multivariate-approach-for)
- Developed RELIEF (REmoval of Latent Inter-scanner Effects through Factorization), a novel method that reduces dimensions and factors interlinked matrices, correcting inter-scanner biases while preserving biological associations, and significantly increasing statistical power compared to existing methods.
- Developed an efficient [R package (RELIEF)](https://github.com/junjypark/RELIEF/tree/master) and built a GitHub repository for sharing simulated examples and codes publicly.

### Scalar on Image Deep Neural Network
- Proposed a regularized Neural Network model for Scalar on Image problems, incorporating Total Variation and L-1 penalties to recover sparse spatial patterns in nonlinear systems.
- Developed a scalable algorithm for efficient parameter estimation and established a generalized framework for prediction and variable selection across various data types, including continuous, binary, and multi-categorical variables.

### fMRI Data Reconstruction, Visualization and Predictive Analytics
[Publication](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00521-021-06789-8)
- Registered fMRI 3D volume to brain Atlas to segment the fMRI anatomy into distinct regions.
- Identified active ROIs using Temporal Contrast-to-noise Ratio (tCNR), applied tensor regression to detect activation, and localized task-activated regions with post hoc statistical mapping.
- Co-developed an efficient [R package (TCIU)](https://github.com/SOCR/TCIU) and built a GitHub repository for sharing simulated examples and codes publicly.
