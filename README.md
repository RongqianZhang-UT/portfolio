## Research Experience
### Mitigating Inter-Scanner Biases in High-Dimensional Neuroimaging Data
- Developed the Spatial Autocorrelation Normalization (SAN) technique, a method to ensure that neuroimaging data remains consistent across different study sites and 
  MRI scanners by mitigating unwanted technical variations at the vertex level (high dimensions).
- Conducted both real data analysis and simulation studies, comparing our new method with existing methods. Our approach demonstrated substantial improvements in 
  reducing unwanted variations in covariances, enhancing data quality and reproducibility. 
- This work marked a pioneering effort in methodological research, introducing spatial modelling to tackle inter-scanner biases and ultimately providing more 
  reliable data for downstream analyses.
